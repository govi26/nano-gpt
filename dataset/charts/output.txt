Here's an example code in Python to count the number of unique words in a file:

```python
def count_unique_words(file_path):
    unique_words = set()

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = line.strip().split()
            unique_words.update(words)

    return len(unique_words)

# Example usage
file_path = 'example.txt'
unique_word_count = count_unique_words(file_path)
print(f"Number of unique words in {file_path}: {unique_word_count}")
```

In this code, the `count_unique_words` function takes a file path as input and returns the count of unique words in the file. It uses a set data structure to keep track of unique words. It opens the file, reads each line, and splits it into words using the `split` method. The `update` method of the set is used to add the words to the set. Finally, the length of the set is returned as the count of unique words.
