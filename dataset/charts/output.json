Inside the function, we initialize an empty set called `unique_words` to keep track of the unique words encountered.\n\nUsing the `open` function, we open the file in read mode and iterate over each line. For each line, we strip any leading/trailing whitespace and split it into words using the `split` method. We then update the `unique_words` set with the new words using the `update` method.\n\nFinally, we return the length of the `unique_words` set, which gives us the count of unique words in the file."
